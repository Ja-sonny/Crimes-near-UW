# Lab4: Map Design and Tile Generation
## Seattle Crime near University of Washington
I searched for crime data in Seattle, and found data from SPD that had crime
data since 2008 to 2020. However, the 2020 data ended in February, so I decided
to use data only from 2019. Additionally, there were way too much data to use
so I narrowed it down to only crimes near University of Washington, which
ended up being crimes in University District.
